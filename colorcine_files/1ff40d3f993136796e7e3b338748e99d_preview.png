Does each of the lines really represent a frame of the film?"},{"answer":"\n                Thank you for your order! If you have just received your print, you must first remove any tape used for packaging. Take extra care doing this. Discard and recycle all cardboard material used in packaging and do not re-use the cardboard material for long-term storage because it is not archival.<br><br>\n                You should always handle the print by the edges and make sure that your hands are clean because the oils from you hands can affect and reduce the archival quality and leave marks on prints - especially in dark areas. Alway try and use both hands to support your print to eliminate the possibility of bending or kinking it. A crease or kink in the print is permanent. Do not use your hands to wipe off dust as this could damage the delicate surface. It is preferable to use canned air but extreme care should be taken to keep the can upright so no liquid is sprayed on the print. A soft dust brush can be gently used as long as the brush is clean and free of any dirt or oils.<br><br>\n                As a general rule, you should be very gentle with your print. You should keep moisture or condensation from getting on the print. Although the ink is quite water resistant, water can still cause damage and leave marks which will be permanently visible once dry. If possible, allow a few extra days for your print to “breathe” before framing. This will insure the inks can completely set and allow gas to escape. Ideally your print should be framed in a method allowing for natural expansion and contraction to occur. Prints have a tendency to expand and contract more in high humidity. If you are unable to do this yourself, search for a professional framer. Ideally you should hang your framed prints in a location that is not in direct sunlight as this may cause fading or discolouration over time.<br><br>\n                With just a little care and by following these tips, you will be able to enjoy your posters for many years to come.\n            ","question":"21.
